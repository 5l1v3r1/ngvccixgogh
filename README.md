# ngvccixgogh
A Bash script to allow automatic profile creation of colour schemes computed by GVCCI via Gogh.

## Setup
- Make sure nlinker.sh and ngoghbase.sh are executable: `chmod +x <file_name>`
- Place both files in your **gvcci** folder
- Run `nlinker.sh` with desired arguments (see below)

## Usage
**nlinker.sh** accepts two arguments, the path to the image you want to get the colours from, and the name of the profile to be created from those colours.

`./nlinker.sh <path/to/image> <name>`

Please know this is an experiment and functionality may change at any time.
